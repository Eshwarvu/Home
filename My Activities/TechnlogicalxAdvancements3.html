						<p><font size = "6">The doorbells fancy features are attached to a fancy price, with the doorbell starting off at US$149.99. It's no wonder that the price tag is so large, 
						considering the amount of technology that is packed into the doorbell. 
						Its camera has a stunning 1536 pixel display in a 1:1 aspect ratio. 
						The camera also comes with HDR, which is a nice to have, but its more stunning features include night vision, which is handy for trespassers and the unlikely robbery.
						Its 12x zoom gives the user a detailed view of who or what is at their door.
						With all these features crammed into one small doorbell, you won't be surpised to know that the Arlo is finding popularity in homes, despite its deterring price tag. </font></p>
