						The world has grown immensely due to the technology that we have today.
						It makes it easier for us to live our lives, and allows for us do create new experiences in ways we've never thought of before, or could even start imagining about 10 years ago.
						These technological advancements ave allowed us to go far in different fields of study, and have helped many to realize their dreams through it.
						Technology has gone so far as to enhancing and aiding cretain fields of study, and allowing us to gather information that would have taken decades to do so without.
						We use computers in almost everything today, the medical field, for monitoring patients, and finding new breakroughs, and the engineering field.
						We can now use computers to compute extremely difficult problems, that would have taken much longer if we had to use our own mind.
						(Unless you're some sort of math genius)</font><p> 

						<p><font size="5"> 
						We have been able to create such amazing opportunities, but as we all know, nothing comes without it's risks.
						Nowadays, everywhere you go, you see people acting as if they were stuck to their devices with glue.
						People are always on some sort of electonical device, and it seems as though we have trading electronical communication for communication in the real world.
						With everyone always stuck on social media networks, and obseessed over the number of followers they have, this world's turned into something else. 
						Hopefully, in the future we will be able to find a balance between online communication and real life. 
						However, the future does not seem like it's likely to change and we may be stuck in this virtual world forever.</font><p>

						New technologies have allowed the medical field to grow immensely and we can now perform extensive surgeries, some of which were almost impossible even just a few years ago. We now have the ablility to look inside of the human body without ever having cutting it up.
						We have heart monitors, which are proving to be extremely useful when monitoring a patient ni critical condition.
						As well as hospital devices, we now have bionic limbs, which perform the same tasks as a normal hand, for those who do no have a certain limb of their own.</font></p>
